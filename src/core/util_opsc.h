 OSC_timeTag.h: library for manipulating OSC time tags
 Matt Wright, 5/29/97

 Time tags in OSC have the same format as in NTP: 64 bit fixed point, with the
 top 32 bits giving number of seconds sinve midnight 1/1/1900 and the bottom
 32 bits giving fractional parts of a second.  We represent this by a 64-bit
 unsigned long if possible, or else a struct. 

 NB: On many architectures with 64-bit ints, it's illegal (like maybe a bus error)
 to dereference a pointer to a 64-bit int that's not 64-bit aligned.

   OSC-client.h: library for constructing OpenSoundControl messages.
   Derived from SynthControl.h
   Author: Matt Wright
   Version 0.1: 6/13/97
   Version 0.2: 7/21/2000: Support for type-tagged messages


   General notes:

   This library abstracts away the data format for the OpenSoundControl
   protocol.  Users of this library can construct OpenSoundControl packets
   with a function call interface instead of knowing how to lay out the bits.

   All issues of memory allocation are deferred to the user of this library.
   There are two data structures that the user must allocate.  The first
   is the actual buffer that the message will be written into.  This buffer
   can be any size, but if it's too small there's a possibility that it
   will become overfull.  The other data structure is called an OSCbuf,
   and it holds all the state used by the library as it's constructing
   a buffer.

   All procedures that have the possibility of an error condition return int,
   with 0 indicating no error and nonzero indicating an error.  The variable
   OSC_errorMessage will be set to point to a string containing an error
   message explaining what the problem is.

/* Here's the basic model for building up OSC messages in an OSCbuf:

    - Make sure the OSCbuf has been initialized with OSC_initBuffer().

    - To open a bundle, call OSC_openBundle().  You can then write 
      messages or open new bundles within the bundle you opened.
      Call OSC_closeBundle() to close the bundle.  Note that a packet
      does not have to have a bundle; it can instead consist of just a 
      single message.
                                  

    - For each message you want to send:

    - Call OSC_writeAddress() with the name of your message.  (In
      addition to writing your message name into the buffer, this
      procedure will also leave space for the size count of this message.)

        - Alternately, call OSC_writeAddressAndTypes() with the name of
          your message and with a type string listing the types of all the
          arguments you will be putting in this message.
    
    - Now write each of the arguments into the buffer, by calling one of:
        OSC_writeFloatArg()
        OSC_writeFloatArgs()
        OSC_writeIntArg()
        OSC_writeStringArg()

    - Now your message is complete; you can send out the buffer or you can
      add another message to it.
