ChucK VERSIONS log
------------------

1.5.1.8 (October 2023) "Halloween Release"
=======
(note) memory management is ghoulishly frightful!

- (fixed) an issue with memory management / reference counting across 
    overloaded operations that return Object
- (fixed) an issue with reference count cleanup on recursive functions
    that return Objects
- (fixed) an issue with reference count cleanup on 'new' operator,
    e.g., (new Foo).f();
- (updated) reduced memory management dependency between language-defined 
    objects and their "parent" shreds
- (updated) --color:ON and --color now will always output ANSI color 
    codes, regardless of TTY status; (FYI --color:AUTO is unchanged
    and is the same as default, i.e., enable color terminal if TTY 
    detected; disable otherwise
- (added, developer) chugins API float array access


1.5.1.7 (October 2023) "vec2"
=======
- (added) new type 'vec2' 2D vector type
    for 2D animation (ChuGL) as well as texture mapping UV or ST 
    coordinates; access fields with .x/.y OR .u/.v OR .s/.t
- (added) new examples/vector/vec2.ck
- (reworked) memory management across function calls that return
    Object types; now correctly tracks all instances within a 
    statement and balances reference counts; previously there was
    a chance that object refcount were not correctly released,
    causing incorrect behavior including memory leaks.
    "dangling object references tracking and cleanup"
    examples include (assumption: foo() returns an Object):
    `foo().bar;` or `foo(), foo()` (multi-expression stmt) or
    `while( foo().bar ) { ... }` (loop stmt) and many more.
- (fixed) incorrect reference count for certain usages of 'null'
    where the expression was interpreted incorrectly as a
    function call, e.g., obj == null


1.5.1.6 (October 2023) patch release
=======
- (fixed) a serious issue accessing vec3/vec4 fields (.x, .y, .z. .w)
  where the operand stack was incorrectly cleaned, which could lead
  to stack overflow. This issue has been addressed.


=======
NOTE: 1.5.1.5 is the alpha-release / soft launch of ChuGL, a unified 
audiovisual programming framework built into the ChucK programming
language. It offers real-time, unified audio synthesis and 3D/2D graphics 
programming in a single strongly-timed language.

1.5.1.5 (October 2023) "operator overloading + chugins API 9.0"
=======
- (added) operator overloading is here!
    Most operator can now be overloaded, within their respective existing
    forms in the language (e.g., binary operators such as '+' and '=>'
    can be overloaded as binary operators, but not as unary operators).
    Similar to class definitions, operator overloads are local in scope 
    to the file context, unless declared with 'public'. operator 
    overloading marked as 'public' will persists until 1) the VM stops or 
    2) the VM is cleared/reset.
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // the general format for overload an operator is as follows:
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // let's say we define a custom class...
    public class Foo { int num; }

    // PUBLIC operator overloading (transcends contexts and files;
    // will persist until stop VM or clear VM. NOTE the use of 'public' 
    // instead of 'fun' (fun for all!)
    public Foo @operator =^( Foo lhs, Foo rhs )
    { /* do stuff for Foo =^ Foo */ return rhs; }

    // LOCAL binary operator overload for '=>' (local to this context)
    fun Foo @operator =>( Foo lhs, Foo rhs )
    { /* do stuff for Foo => Foo */ return rhs; }

    // define binary operator overload for '+'
    fun Foo @operator +( Foo lhs, Foo rhs )
    { Foo retval; lhs.num + rhs.num => retval.num; return retval; }

    // define binary operator overload for '*'
    fun Foo @operator *( Foo lhs, Foo rhs )
    { Foo retval; lhs.num * rhs.num => retval.num; return retval; }

    // define unary operator overload for '!'
    fun int @operator !( Foo foo )
    { return !foo.num; }

    // define postfix operator overload for '++'
    fun Foo @operator ( Foo foo ) ++
    { foo.num++; return foo; }

    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // using the new overloaded operators
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
    // create 2 Foos
    Foo a, b; 1 => a.num; 2 => b.num;
    // operator in action (follows default ck operator precedence)
    a + b * b + a @=> Foo c;
    // post ++ on c
    c++;
    // should print 7
    <<< c.num >>>;
    //-----------------------------------------------------------
- (added) new examples showing basic operator overloading usage
    examples/oper/overload_overview.ck
    examples/oper/overload_pre_post.ck
    examples/oper/overload_public.ck
    examples/oper/overload_gru.ck
- (added) the "gruck operator" --> (graphical chuck operator) as part
    of ChuGL (ChucK Graphics Library), which will be part of the ChucK
    language
- (added) Machine function to on-the-fly control operator overloading stack
    static void resetOperators();
        Reset operator overloading state to default startup state; 
        removes all public @operator overloads; use with care.
- (added) new Machine function for getting number of shreds currently in VM
	static int numShreds();
	    Get the number of shreds currently in the VM.
- (added) improved exception reporting and stack-overflow detection and 
    handling. Overall, these change improve system robustness and runtime
    information.
- (added) two new (and somewhat arcane) Shred methods to support "extreme 
    shredding" use cases:
        ----
	int childMemSize( int sizeInBytes );
	    Set size hint of per-shred call stack ("mem") for children 
	    shreds subsequently sporked from the calling shred (NOTE this 
	    size hint does not affect the calling shred--only its 
	    descendants); if sizeInBytes <= 0, the size hint is set to 
	    the VM default. (FYI This is an arcane functionality that 
	    most programmers never need to worry about. Advanced usage: 
	    set size hint to small values (e.g., 1K) to support A LOT 
	    (e.g., >10000) of simultaneous shreds; set size hint to large 
	    values (e.g., >65K) to spork functions with extremely deep 
	    recursion, or to support A LOT (>10000) of declared local 
	    variables. Use with care.)
	int childMemSize();
	    Get the memory stack size hint (in bytes) for shreds sporked 
	    from this one.
	int childRegSize( int sizeInBytes );
	    Set size hint of per-shred operand stack ("reg") for children 
	    shreds subsequently sporked from the calling shred (NOTE this 
	    size hint does not affect the calling shred--only its 
	    descendants); if sizeInBytes <= 0, the size hint is set to 
	    the VM default. (FYI This is an arcane functionality 
	    that most programmers never need to worry about. Advanced 
	    usage: set size hint to small values (e.g., 256 bytes) to 
	    support A LOT (>10000) of simultaneous shreds; set size hint 
	    to large values (e.g., >20K) to spork functions with 
	    extremely lengthy (>10000) statements, including array 
	    initializer lists. Use with care.)
	int childRegSize();
	    Get the operand stack size hint (in bytes) for shreds sporked 
	    from this one.
        ----
- (added) FileIO.open() now takes "special:auto" as the filename (output
    only) to write to a new file with auto-generated filename in the 
    current directory (based on the current system time, precise to 
    second;NOTE files created into way at the same system time will have 
    the same auto-generated filename and may conflict or fail to open).
    The "auto" prefix and extension can be set and retrieved using the
    following new functions to FileIO:
	---
	string autoExtension();
	    Get auto extension for "special:auto" filename generation 
	    (applicable to file writing only).
	string autoPrefix();
	    Get auto prefix for "special:auto" filename generation 
	    (applicable to file writing only).
	void autoPrefixExtension( string prefix, string extension );
	    Set auto prefix and extension for "special:auto" filename 
	    generation (applicable to file writing only).
	---
- (fixed) float *=> vec4 now works as intended (instead of producing a
    a compilation error)
- (fixed) on Windows and --verbose level SYSTEM or higher, when a chugin
    fails to load, instead of displaying a cryptic error code (e.g., 
    "reason: 1920"), the error code is translating into an error message 
    and displayed (e.g., "reason: The file cannot be accessed by the system.")
    (azaday)
- (fixed) on certain systems, program ending with a single-line // comment
    could crash; affects miniAudicle, WebChucK, Machine.eval() containing
    code that ending with a trailing comment
- (fixed) on-the-fly programming (OTF) system was incorrectly cleaning
    up file descriptors and leading to instability
- (updated) ConsoleInput.prompt( text ) now no longer prints an extra 
    space (" ") after prompt text
- (updated) chugins headers version incremented to 9.0
- (added; chugins development) overhauled dynamic linking API to access
    chuck host-side operations; this greatly expands chugins capabilities
    but will unfortunately require API changes that will break chugin
    builds that uses the existing API.
    (check out chuck_dl.h: `namespace Chuck_DL_Api`)
- (added; chugins development) ability to overload operators from chugin
    query functions in C++:
    // add binary operator overload; args included
    f_add_op_overload_binary add_op_overload_binary;
    // add unary (prefix) operator overload; arg included
    f_add_op_overload_prefix add_op_overload_prefix;
    // add unary (postfix) operator overload; arg included
    f_add_op_overload_postfix add_op_overload_postfix;
- (added; chugins development) capability to invoke chuck language-side
    member functions (in chuck) from chugins (in C++)
    // invoke Object member function (defined either in chuck or c++)
    // NOTE this will call the member function in IMMEDIATE MODE,
    // marking it as a time-critical function when called in this 
    // manner; any time/event operations therein will throw an exception
    Chuck_DL_Return API->vm->invoke_mfun_immediate_mode( 
        Chuck_Object * obj, t_CKUINT func_vt_offset, Chuck_VM * vm, 
        Chuck_VM_Shred * shred, Chuck_DL_Arg * ARGS, t_CKUINT numArgs );
- (added; chugins development) new API->type API for C++/chugins to 
    lookup types in the type system, virtual function offsets (useful
    for API->vm->invoke_mfun_immediate_mode() above)
- (added and updated; chugins development) across all existing
    chugins DL API and many additions; the chugins runtime API 9.0
    =============================

    =============================


1.5.1.3 (September 2023) "ChucK to School"
=======
(note) this release of chuck addresses a number of issues from long-time 
    language bugs to documentation updates to expanding Machine functions 
    for VM/shred management to improved Open Sound Control support. Over 
    the dozen releases since chuck-1.5.0.0, this release is strongly-timed
    for students and instructors coming back to school in Fall 2023!
    (One of our ongoing priorities is to make the language + tools 
    better for teaching, research, and of course music making.)

- (updated) Machine.add()/replace()/remove()/status() now re-implemented
    internally for both performance and greater compatibility (now can
    be used with no dependencies on OTF system, make it possible to call
    these from systems like WebChucK).
- (added) new and updated Machine functions
	---------
	** new ** static int removeLastShred();
	    Remove the most recently added shred in the VM (could be the
	    shred calling this function); returns the ID of the removed 
	    shred.
	** new ** static int resetShredID();
	    Reset shred IDs to 1 + the highest current shred ID in the VM; 
	    can be used as shred management to keep shred IDs low, after 
	    a lot of sporks. Returns what the next shred ID would be.
	** new ** static void removeAllShreds();
	    Remove all shreds in the VM (including the shred calling this 
	    function).
	** new ** static void clearVM();
	    Reset the type system, removing all user-defined types and all 
	    global variables; removes all shreds in the VM (including the 
	    shred calling this function). Use with care.
	** new ** static void printStatus();
	    Print (to terminal or console) the current status of the VM.
	** new ** static void printTimeCheck();
	    Print (to terminal or console) the current time information in
	    the VM.
	-------------
	** updated ** static int add( string path );
	    Compile and spork a new shred from file at 'path' into the VM; 
	    returns the new shred ID. It is possible to include arguments 
	    with the file being added, e.g., `Machine.add( 
	   "foo.ck:bar:3:5.0" )`.
	** updated ** static int replace( int id, string path );
	    Replace shred with new shred from file. Returns new shred ID, 
	    or 0 on error. It is possible to include arguments, e.g., 
	    `Machine.replace( outID, "foo.ck:bar:3:5.0" )`.
	** updated ** static int remove( int id );
	    Remove shred from VM by shred ID (returned by Machine.add).
	** updated ** static int status();
	    Print the current status of the VM;
	    legacy version of printStatus().
	-------------
- (updated) Machine.add( filepath ) no longer introduces a potential
    real-time audio interruption on macOS ** for all filepath that does 
    not contain ~ **; currently, path resolution for ~ or ~[username] in 
    macOS consistently causes audio clicks, likely due to implementation
    of underlying system function (e.g., wordexp()) to resolve ~ 
    (hypothesis: wordexp() function performs IO-blocking)
- (added) function to expand platform specific file path
	static string expandPath( string path );
	    Expand platform-specific filepath to an absolute path, which 
	    is returned. On macOS and Linux expandPath() will attempt to 
	    resolve `~` or `~[username]`; on Windows expandPath() will 
	    attempt to resolve %USERNAME%. (Known issue: (macOS) 
	    expandPath currently introduced an audio click; it 
	    recommended to call expandPath() at the beginning; e.g., 
	    expanding path ahead of time could avoid a click instead of 
	    calling Machine.add() on a filepath with `~`.)
- (added) a new (3rd) string.replace() function
	void replace( string from, string to );
	    Replace all instances of 'from' in the string with 'to'.
  (for reference the existing string.replace() function)
	void replace( int position, string str );
	    Replace characters from 'position' with contents of 'str'.
	void replace( int position, int length, string str );
	    Replace 'length' characters from 'position' with contents of 'str'.
- (added) examples/string/replace.ck
- (updated) move real-time audio system warnings to log level "WARN"; this 
    should result in less clutter printed, in particular on Linux/ALSA.
- (updated) CKDoc now prints class functions before variables
- (added, chugin development) new backend chugin <=> chuck host API 
    functions for array.size(), array.get_idx(), array.get_key()
    (@nshaheed) 
- (fixed) various documentation misspellings (thanks @barak)
- (fixed) variable look-up priorities when multiple variables of the same 
    name are declared in various situations in the same file (shadowing); 
    this resolves issues within a subclass incorrectly accessing 
    variables of the same name (declared as local variable vs. member in 
    a parent class vs. global-scope variables), depending on where it's
    accessed from.
    ---
    updated convention for value lookup priority (in case of shadowing)
    1) first look in the same scope
    2) if not found, and if inside a class def, look up-scope within 
       class (but no further)
    3) if not found, and if inside a class def, look in parent (for 
       inherited value)
    4) if still not found, look all the way up to global scope
    ---
    for example: chuck/src/test/01-Basic/194-value-lookup-order.ck
    ---
- (fixed) using => to connect from/to empty UGen array declaration no 
    longer results in a crash; instead there is now a compiler error:
```
a.ck:8:17: error: cannot connect '=>' to empty array '[ ]' declaration...
[8] [foo] => SinOsc bars[];
                    ^
a.ck: ...(hint: declare 'bars' as an non-empty array)
a.ck: ...(or if assignment was the intent, use '@=>' instead)
```
- (fixed) duplicate function declaration no longer causes a crash after
    reporting the error
```
// example of duplicate function declarations
fun void bar() { }
fun void bar() { }
```
- (fixed) assigning to constants such as `pi`, `second`, or `Math.PI` now
    results in a compiler error; previously the outcome was undefined and
    in certain case could cause a crash.
- (fixed) concatenating a function reference with a string now produces a
    compiler error; previously this would lead to a runtime crash.
```
a.ck:17:9: error: cannot perform '+' on string and '[function]'
[17] <<< " " + f.getFoo >>>;
             ^
a.ck:17:13: error: ...(hint: to call the function, add '()' and any arguments)
[17] <<< " " + f.getFoo >>>;
                 ^
```
- (fixed) an issue appending arrays to arrays for non-integer types
```
float foo[0][0]; float bar[0];
foo << bar;
```
- (fixed) an issue with OscOut on Windows, which can crash on object cleanup
    due to incorrect windows-specific socket closing
- (fixed; reworked) OSC dispatch for multiple OscIn clients listening on 
    the same OSC address; the crash has bee resolved, and the OSC 
    incoming server message dispatch has been reworked
- (re-added) 'Chubgraph' has been "re-deprecated", which actually means 
    older code that use 'Chubgraph' instead of 'Chugraph" will now work
    again, with the deprecation warning (previously `Chubgraph` would 
    result in a compiler error):
    `deprecated: 'Chubgraph' --> use: 'Chugraph' instead`
- (updated) minor improvements in compiler error reporting; more 
    accurate position accuracy for binary operators, including =>,
    @=>, and =^
- (updated) log level 3 (SEVERE) has been renamed to (HERALD)
- (updated) improved stability on ctrl-c shutdown for real-time audio
    and HID management
- (added) examples/effects/autotune.ck
---
- (added) WebChucK support for Machine.add()/replace()/remove()/removeAll()
- (added) WebChucK IDE now supports the ability to upload .ck files for 
    Machine (@terryzfeng) https://chuck.stanford.edu/ide/
- (updated) for Chugin developers, the `chuginate` tool has been 
    modernized (spencer and ge) -- 0) chuginate updated from using
    python2 to python3; 1) in addition to a boilerplate C++ project for 
    a chugin, chuginate now also generates a boilerplate NAME-test.ck 
    ChucK program; 2) more informative comments in the boilerplate C++ 
    code; 3) updated makefiles for all platforms.


1.5.1.2 (August 2023)
=======
- (updated) the long-time and often cryptic "cannot bind to port: 8888"
    message has been reworked: 1) an explanation has been added to the
    possible cause (e.g., another chuck VM is running and currently
    has the port open) and implication (this chuck VM will not receive
    OTF commands over the network); 2) the printing of this message has
    been moved by default to log level 2 (SYSTEM) with further information
    on log level 5 (INFO) UNLESS the '--loop` flag is present, which
    signals intention to use the VM as an OTF command listener (and the
    warning is more likely to be relevant information). This should
    hopefully reduce confusion, as well as improve automations that
    examine the output of chuck. (thanks to @barak for elucidating the
    issue!)
- (added) --cmd-listener:{on|off} enables or disables listening for 
    network OTF (on-the-fly programming) command messages (e.g., add, 
    replace, remove, etc.). The default is ON; setting to OFF will prevent 
    chuck VM from attempting to open network server listener. (NOTE: this 
    option does NOT affect in-language networking, e.g., with Open Sound
    Control.)


1.5.1.1 (August 2023)
=======
(note) this patch release fixes a number of issues related to recently added
    language features; it also adds some "syntactic sugar" in the form of
    allowing trailing commas in array initializer lists, as well as a set 
    of range() functions for generating arrays of ranges of value.

- (added) trailing commas in array initializer lists are now permitted
```
// an array initializer list (aka array literal), as usual
[1,2,3] @=> int foo[];

// now also permitted: trailing comma after last element
[1,2,3,] @=> int bar[];
```
- (added) Std functions for generating arrays containing a range of 
    values (nshaheed)
	static int[] Std.range( int stop );
	    Return array containing the range [0,stop).
	static int[] Std.range( int start, int stop );
	    Return array containing the range [start,stop).
	static int[] Std.range( int start, int stop, int step );
	    Return array containing values from start up to (but not including) stop,
	    hopping by step.
- (re-added) backtick(`)-delimited strings; context: needed for FaucK
    (FAUST in ChucK) through the Faust chugin
- (fixed) issue related to multiple empty statements (e.g., ;;;;) being
    incorrectly handled by the function control path analysis
- (fixed) issue related to incorrect out-of-order dependencies across
    different files / contexts (thanks Michael Heuer for investigating)
- (fixed) class member/static variables can now be accessed, as before,
    from anywhere in the same file, regardless of order of declaration
    (thanks Michael Heuer for investigating)
```
Foo foo;
// using val above declaration is part of language semantics
// (but due to regression bug was broken in 1.5.0.8)
// this should work once again
5 => foo.val;

class Foo
{
    int val;
}
```
- (updated) 'auto' type is now disallowed as a top-level class variables,
    instance or static; since these variables could be used from outside the class,
    1) this potentially leads to more intentional code and 2) currently there is no
    mechanism to resolve the 'auto' until type checking stage such that out-of-order
    access of class variables are resolved.
```
// class definition
class Foo
{
    // ok
    for( auto x : [1,2,3] ) { <<< x >>>; }
    // ok
    fun void bar() { 4 => auto y; }
    // ok
    if( true ) { 5 => auto x; }
    // ok
    { 6 => auto x; }
    // not ok *** compiler should report error
    7 => auto m_var;
    // not ok *** compiler should report error
    8 => static auto m_var;
}
```
- (fixed) a memory leak associated with array declarations
- (fixed) chout and cherr now properly accounts for IO redirect out of
    chuck; this addresses issue with miniAudicle console output, and
    also affects other C++ hosts embedding chuck core.


1.5.1.0 (August 2023)
=======
(note) this release (1.5.1.0) updates a long-standing policy regarding 
`return`statements in function declarations; adds @array.sort(), a new 
command-line option, general bug fixes and stability improvements.

(note) much has been added between 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.1.0, including:
  * new for-each loop syntax for iterating through arrays (1.5.0.8)
  * enhanced and more accurate compiler error reporting; now
    highlights code and pinpointing error location in code (1.5.0.5)
  * color terminal support for CLI chuck (1.5.0.5)
  * expanded class library support in IO, random number generation,
    Machine.eval(), chugins management, and array
  * new features in CLI chuck, miniAudicle, WebChucK & IDE
  * (developer) The Great ChucK Repo Cleanup of 2023 (1.5.0.2)
  * (developer) streamlined c++ integration for those wishing to
    incorporate ChucK core into other c++ hosts (1.5.0.7)
    https://github.com/ccrma/chuck/tree/main/src/host-examples
  * (see below for more information)
===
- (update) `return` statements in function definitions:

PREVIOUSLY: chuck does not require all control paths in non-void 
functions to explicitly return values -- in cases of missing `return` 
statements at the end of a function, ChucK implicitly sets the return 
value to some form of 0 or null, depending on the return type.

NEW: the chuck compiler now rejects non-void function definitions in 
which not all control paths return a value, and will print a compiler
error in the form of:

  "error: not all control paths in 'fun int f()' return a value"

RATIONALE: while *** this may break some existing code (apologies!) ***
that assumed the previous return semantics (or forgot to return a value
or accidentally declared a function as returning something when it should
return `void`), we believe this change will be more beneficial in the
long-term and will lead to clearer, more intentional code.

example:
```
// as of chuck-1.5.1.0, will result in a compiler error
fun int foo()
{
    // no return
}
```

ChucK performs syntactical analysis of function control paths:
```
// this is valid code, even though the function does not end in a `return`
fun float foo( int v )
{
    if( v == 1 ) return 1;
    else if( v == 2 ) return 2;
    else return 3;
}

// this code will result in a compiler error, since there is no `else`
// and no subsequent `return`
fun float foo( int v )
{
    if( v == 1 ) return 1;
    else if( v == 2 ) return 2;
}
```
- (added) array sorting
	void sort()
        Sort the contents of the array in ascending order.
  ** array sorting semantics, by type **
        int[]: sort by value
      float[]: sort by value
    complex[]: sort by magnitude (2-norm) with phase as tie-breaker
      polar[]: sort by magnitude with phase as tie-breaker
       vec3[]: sort by magnitude with x then y then z
       vec4[]: sort by magnitude with x then y then z then w
- (added) new examples
    |- examples/array/array_sort.ck
- (added) IO (cherr, chout, FileIO) for complex, polar, vec3, vec3
    e.g., cherr <= #(1,1) <= IO.nl();
    e.g., chout <= #(1,1)$polar <= IO.nl();
- (added) overloaded Std.getenv() variant (thanks @ynohtna)
        string getenv(string value)
        Get the value of an environment variable, returning the provided 
            default if unset.
- (added) --pid-file:<FILENAME> CLI option (thanks @ynohtna)
    "If this flag is specified with argument, chuck will attempt to write 
     its process ID to the given file upon startup, and then remove that 
     file upon shutdown. This assists external process supervision 
     (through tools like monit,etc) for long-running installations that 
     need auto-rebooting, instant kill switches for live performances, 
     and other programmatic external process control."
- (fixed) for-each for complex, polar, vec3, vec4 types;
    (e.g., `for( vec3 n : myVec3Array ) { ... }`
- (fixed) compiler issue (introduced in 1.5.0.8) where a declaration in 
    the middle of a three-part chuck statement incorrectly reports error
    that variable already declared (e.g., `440 => float f => osc.freq;`)
- (fixed) error reporting printing for a few binary and unary operators:
    spork ~, typeof, sizeof, new, <-, ->
- (fixed) implicit cast from 'int' to 'float' in function returns;
    (e.g., `fun float foo() { return 5; }`)


1.5.0.8 (August 2023)
=======
(note) this release introduces a for-each control structure for more 
easily iterating over arrays, as well as an experimental 'auto' type. 
array support has also been expanded; internally, engine support has been 
added for a number of features in WebChucK and WebChucK IDE, including 
retrieving and display the chuck 'now', along with a number of critical 
chuck parameters; updated ChucK c++ integration

- (added) new 'for' control structure in this general syntax:
      for( VAR : ARRAY )
      { ... }
    where VAR is a declared variable of the same base type as the ARRAY,
    in each iteration of the for loop body, VAR will take on the value of
    each element in ARRAY, until the end of ARRAY is reached. For example:
      ```
      // create empty array
      float array[0];
      // append
      array << 1 << 2.5 << 3;
      // for each element 'x' in array
      for( float x : array )
      {
          // print the element
          <<< x >>>;
      }
      ```
    or loop over an array literal of values:
      ```
      // iterating over an array literal
      for( int x : [ 1, 2, 3 ] ) { <<< x >>>; }
      ```
- (added) new examples using for-each control structure
    examples/array/foreach-1.ck
    examples/array/foreach-2.ck
    examples/array/foreach-3.ck
    examples/array/foreach-4.ck
    examples/array/foreach-5.ck
    examples/array/foreach-6.ck
    examples/ctrl/ctrl_foreach.ck
- (added) new 'auto' type; in certain declarations, infers the actual
  type of a variable from context. For example:
     ```
     // 'a' will be automatically typed as 'float'
     1.5 => auto a;
     // 'arr' will be automatically typed as 'int[]'
     [1,2,3] @=> auto arr[];
     // can use in the new for-each control structure
     for( auto x : arr )
     // x is automatically typed as 'int'
     { <<< x >>>; }
     ```
- (added) new examples for 'auto'
    examples/type/type_auto.ck
    examples/array/foreach-auto1.ck
    examples/array/foreach-auto2.ck
- (added) new array operations
	void erase(int position)
	    Remove element at 'position' from the array.
	void erase(int begin, int end)
	    Remove element(s) in the range [begin,end).
	void popFront()
	    Remove the first element of the array.
  See full array API reference with examples:
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/reference/base.html#@array
- (added) new array examples
    examples/array/array_append.ck
    examples/array/array_erase.ck
    examples/array/array_erase2.ck
- (update) map-only function @array.find(string) has been renamed to
    @array.isInMap(string) to avoid confusion with vector
- (added) error checking for out-of-order dependency issues where
  a function is called (or a class instantiated) that would skip
  a needed variable initialization; this addresses a long-standing
  issue that has caused much confusion because previously the issue
  failed but silently.
  ---
  For example, consider this 'foobar.ck' code
  ```
    // does not work here: precedes 'bar' initialization
    foo();
    // where 'bar' initializes
    5 => int bar;
    // FYI calling foo() works here: after 'bar' initializes
    // foo();

    // the function definition
    fun void foo()
    {
        // needs 'bar' to be initialized
        <<< "bar:", bar >>>;
    }
  ```
  The new resulting compiler error:
  ```
    > chuck foobar.ck
    foobar.ck:4:1: error: calling 'foo()' at this point skips
                   initialization of a needed variable:
    [4] foo();
        ^
    foobar.ck:7:10: error: ...(note: this skipped variable
                    initialization is needed by 'fun void foo()')
    [7] 5 => int bar;
                 ^
    foobar.ck:16:17: error: ...(note: this is where the variable
                     is used within 'fun void foo()')
    [16]     <<< "bar:", bar >>>;
                         ^
    error-depend-var.ck: ...(hint: try calling 'foo()' after the
                         variable initialization)
  ```
  ---
  Similar errors are reported for class definitions that reference
    file-top-level variables, etc.
- (added) error reporting for public class definitions that access
    out-of-class local variables and functions; this is necessary
    to disallow since public classes can be instantiated from any
    context (file or code)
- (updated, documentation) STK classes HnkyTonk and FrencHrn now 
  properly included in the API reference, and with more examples:
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/reference/ugens-stk.html#HnkyTonk
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/reference/ugens-stk.html#FrencHrn
- (added) new STK examples
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/stk/honkeytonk-algo1.ck
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/stk/honkeytonk-algo3.ck
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples/stk/frenchrn-algo2.ck
- (added) new examples for Event and SndBuf and repeat
    examples/event/event-extend2.ck
    examples/basic/doh.ck
    examples/ctrl/ctrl_repeat.ck
- (added) error checking for public class definitions using an external 
    file-level, non-global variable
- (updated, developer) core VM code streamlined for cleaner operation
  regarding shreds status, remove.all, and access to these from C++;
  can now use a callback function to get replies from VM queue_msg()
- (updated, developer) re-worked ChucK::compileFile() and
    ChucK::compileCode() to immediately make sporked shred ID available
- (developer, added) a 4th example host code in C++ showing how to embed
  ChucK core as a component inside a host C++ program and get shred info
    example-4-shreds.cpp (working with shreds and VM msg queue)
- (updated, developer) WebChucK API expansion including the following
  methods available in javascript that calls down to ChucK core:
    chuck.now()
    void chuck.setParamInt( string, number )
    void chuck.setParamFloat( string, number )
    void chuck.setParamString( string, string )
    number chuck.getParamInt( string )
    number chuck.getParamFloat( string )
    string chuck.getParamString( string )
- (updated, developer) VM instruction dump (through +d flag) now
    prints control structures and other statements

WebChucK/IDE-- a number of UI updates with underlying VM support:
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/ide/
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/webchuck/
===
miniAudicle (macOS) critical install bug (which affects those who 
installed chuck-1.5.0.5 through 1.5.0.7 on macOS) is now addressed, if 
you are experiencing strangeness with opening CK files, try this 
troubleshooting recommendation:
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/release/images/mA-install-duplicate.jpg


1.5.0.7 (July 2023)
=======
(note) this patch release contains general internal maintenance for 
  developers; it also accompanies a critical bug fix in miniAudicle

- (update/fixed) now --version and --about command-line flags will
  correctly print all available audio drivers options, e.g.,
  ```
  chuck version: 1.5.0.7-dev (chai)
     macOS | 64-bit
     audio driver: CoreAudio
     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/
     http://chuck.stanford.edu/
  ```
  ```
  > chuck --version
  chuck version: 1.5.0.7 (chai)
     Linux | 64-bit
     audio drivers: ALSA | PulseAudio | JACK
     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/
     http://chuck.stanford.edu/
  ```
  ```
  > chuck --version
  chuck version: 1.5.0.7 (chai)
     Microsoft Windows | 64-bit
     audio drivers: ASIO | DirectSound | WASAPI
     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/
     http://chuck.stanford.edu/
  ```
- (developer, updated) internal streamlining of chuck core, which is
  now completely decoupled from knowledge of system audio I/O;
  this makes chuck core cleaner, more portable, and easier to integrate
  as a component
- (developer, added) examples hosts code in C++ showing how to embed
  ChucK core as a component inside a host C++ program:
  src/host-examples/
  example-1-minimal.cpp (no real-time audio)
  example-2-audio.cpp (real-time audio)
  example-3-globals.cpp (communication between C++ and ChucK)
- (developer, added) chuck core can now be built without specifying
  additional macros, added new core build flavor: 'vanilla'
  ```
  src/core> make vanilla
  ```
  Builds all source inside src/core, no flags and no linking
  (The vanilla build is not intended for production but for development.)
- (developer, updated) internal cleanup of platform macros:
  __PLATFORM_APPLE__
  __PLATFORM_LINUX__
  __PLATFORM_WINDOWS__
  __PLATFORM_EMSCRIPTEN__
  __PLATFORM_ANDROID__
  (with additional sub-platform macros)


1.5.0.6 (July 2023)
=======
- (fixed, high priority) VM replace print crash
- (updated) VM operation message colors


1.5.0.5 (July 2023)
=======
- (added) color TTY support for command-line chuck is here! ChucK in
  color! compiler errors, probes, logs, on-the-fly programming (OTF),
  and other messages are now output in color, when chuck detects it is 
  outputting to a TTY (e.g., interactive terminal).
- (added) color TTY can can be explicitly enabled/disabled using
  --color and --no-color when running chuck on the command line
- (added) color TTY support for --verbose --probe and --chugin-probe
  ===
- (added) chuck compiler now highlights code when reporting 
  compiler errors, pinpointing the error location
  ```
  terminal> chuck test/06-Errors/error-no-memb2.ck
    error-no-memb2.ck:3:5: error: class 'SinOsc' has no member 'test'
    [3] foo.test();
            ^
  terminal> chuck test/06-Errors/error-syntax-1.ck
    error-syntax-1.ck:5:12: syntax error
    [5] */ it @ is not ! valid => syntax!
                   ^
  ```
- (added) error message when given a directory name instead of .ck file
  ```
  terminal> chuck myFolder
  [chuck]: cannot parse file: 'myFolder' is a directory
  ```
- (added) --disable-error-show-code command line flag to not print code 
  highlighting when reporting compiler errors this is a compatibility flag 
  and is mainly used for unit testing
  ===
- (updated) Machine.eval() execution semantics 
  *** NEW: Machine.eval() now will immediately spork and run
  the evaluated code as a new shred, and automatically yield the current 
  shred to give the new shred a chance to run, without advancing time.
  *** PREVIOUSLY: Machine.eval() sent an ADD message, this incurs a 
  one sample delay and does not run immediately
  ---
  For example, this one line program under the NEW behavior will print
  1 before "foo"; the PREVIOUS behavior would print "foo" first and will
  not print 1 until time is advanced by a > 0 amount
  ```
  Machine.eval( "<<< 1 >>>;" );
  <<< "foo" >>>;
  ```
- (updated) examples/machine/eval.ck -- updated to reflect the above
- (added) examples/machine/eval-global.ck -- shows the new Machine.eval()
  in action to synchronously modify a shared global variable
- (added) examples/machine/version.ck -- ever wonder which chuck language
  version you are currently using?
- (added) scientific notations for floating point
  <<< 123e4 >>>; // prints 1230000.000000 :(float)
- (added) hexidecimal float literals
  <<< 0x1p-4 >>>; // prints 0.062500 :(float)
- (updated) chugins with errors during query are no longer loaded,
  and is more clearly reported (LOG level -v3 or above)
- (updated) more robust parsing of code literals
- (updated, developer) repaying ancient debt -- AST tree cleanup
- (updated, developer) reworking chuck_vm_debug system
- (updated, developer) renaming global names CK_* or ck_* to minimize 
  conflict when using chuck-core as component


1.5.0.4 (June 2023)
=======
- (added) Math.randomize() -- implicitly randomize RNG seed
  ---
  "Randomize the seed of the random number generator (RNG), using an
   non-deterministic mechanism. Whereas srandom() explicitly seeds the
   RNG and will produce a deterministic sequence of pseudo-random
   numbers, randomize() "shakes things up" and causes RNG to start
   generating from a practically unpredicable seed. The quality of
   randomize() depends on the underlying implementation."
- (added) examples
    |- math/randomize.ck -- shows Math.randomize() in action
    |- math/maybe.ck -- can't decide? flip a coin with maybe
    |- math/int-dist.ck -- simulates distribution of Math.random2()
- (updated) improved RNG behavior that probably no one will notice
- (fixed) assignments into a full array declaration now results in a
  compiler error (previously this would cause a crash). for example:
  === code ===
    [1,2] @=> int foo[2];
  === resulting compiler error ===
    cannot assign '@=>' to full array declaration...
      |- hint: declare right-hand-side as empty array
      |- e.g., int foo[]
- (note) as before, assignments into a full non-array declaration still 
  works, effectively treating the right-hand-side declaration as a 
  reference:
  === code ===
    // effective same as new Object @=> Object @ foo;
    // works as before
    new Object @=> Object foo;
- (added) --chugin-probe command-line flag to probe (and verify version)
  for chugins and auto-load chuck sources in the search paths; print 
  results and any version mismatches (e.g., `chuck --chugin-probe`)
  also, explicited named chugins can be probed using --chugins:[FILE]
  (e.g., `chuck --chugin:Foo.chug --chugin:Bar.chug --chugin-probe`) 
- (added) chugins loading in search directories now will recursively
  search in subdirectories
- (added, macOS + Linux) ~/.chuck/lib added to the list of default
  search directories; this makes it easier to locally install/organize
  chugins (and auto-load .ck files) without administrator privilege
  ---

    C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\ChucK\chugins
  ---
- (updated) chuck --verbose output now streamlined and more effectively
  describes what is happening under-the-hood; e.g.,
    `chuck [FILENAMES] -v2` to see SYSTEM output
    `chuck [FILENAMES] -v5` to see INFORM output
    `chuck [FILENAMES] -v10` to see ALL!!! output
- (updated) setting chuck log level is no longer logged below INFORM
  log-level
- (fixed, developer) distinct notions of base type reference and array 
  reference; for example SinOsc @ foo[] -> `SinOsc @` is base type 
  reference and `foo[]` is array reference
- (fixed, developer) instruction dumps (via +d flag) more correctly
  prints reference-related (@) declarations and new operations


1.5.0.3 (June 2023)
=======
- (fixed) chuck audio I/O now correctly carries out extended probing
  for default input and output devices with differing sample rates,
  e.g., with some bluetooth mic/headphones whose input is limited
  to 24kHZ, including some AirPods.
- (note) beyond the above, this release is a follow-up maintenance
  release; please see 1.5.0.1 and earlier release notes  to see recent
  feature updates
- (updated) examples/README now has more useful information
- (updated) README.md streamlined and linux build instructions improved.
- (updated, developer) `make linux-all` (or simply `make linux`) now
  builds all supported drivers (e.g., ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK); this is
  equivalent in outcome to `make linux-alsa linux-pulse linux-jack`
- (updated, developer) makefile streamlined


1.5.0.2 (June 2023)
=======
(note) this is primarily a maintenance release; please see 1.5.0.1
  and earlier release notes  to see recent feature updates

- (fixed) (jack, linux/unix) port name now accounts for regex meta
  characters (thanks @gyroplast and @garyscavone)
- (developer) house cleaning on the chuck git repository
  |- migrated large files out of 'chuck' and into a new 'chuck-media' repo
  |- streamlined release notes and moved to top level
  |- removed outdated files
  |- added additional information including ChucK History into README.md
-- NOTE TO DEVELOPERS --
  The Great ChucK Repo Cleanup of 2023 has been completed! As a 
result, the overall chuck repo size has been reduced from 721MB to 
25MB. Since git works by cloning the entire repo and all history, this 
massively improves the speed of git clone, git submodule update --init in 
repos that reference chuck, and the size of each chuck clone on disk. 
  To accomplish this, we had to "rewrite the git history," which is 
a semi-cataclysmic process for git repos. As a result, all existing 
clones of the chuck, miniAudicle, and chunity repos as well as branches 
and pull-requests that reference the older repo *** are now invalid ***. 
Please do a fresh clone of the chuck/miniAudicle/chunity repos and copy 
any important changes to these fresh clones before making any further 
changes to avoid headaches! 
  NOTE: do not use git pull with your existing, pre-cleanup chuck 
repo as it will seem to work BUT will put your local repo into a messed 
up state. A fresh git clone is necessary before proceeding with chuck 
development! We believe that the cleaner, smoother ChucK dev experience 
will be worth this short-term inconvenience. Apologies for any confusion 
that may arise, and thank you for being involved in ChucK development!
  A "legacy" pre-cleanup fork of the repository before the Cleanup
has been archived here: https://github.com/spencersalazar/chuck-legacy
---
miniAudicle (added: few helpful features)
- (added) menu "Help" now has items that will open websites in
  the default browser:
  "ChucK Class Library Reference..."
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/reference/
  "ChucK Documentation..."
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/
  "ChucK Community..."
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/community/
- (updated) menu "Help" now correctly directs user to miniAudicle
  and ChucK websites:
  "ChucK website..."
    https://chuck.stanford.edu/
  "miniAudicle website..."
    https://github.com/ccrma/miniAudicle/
- (added, Windows/Linux) Device Browser now has an "Audio driver"
  drop-down box that can select an available driver to view its
  associated audio devices


1.5.0.1 (June 2023)
=======
- (added) WvOut support for multiple bit-depths: 16-bit signed int,
  24-bit signed int, 32-bit signed int, 32-bit float, 64-bit float

- (fixed) (Windows) HID joystick input
    |- note: certain joystick devices (including some XBox One gamepads)
       are recognized but do not receive input data; a workaround is to
       install explicitly HID drivers for these devices; see
    |- https://www.snes9x.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?t=27510&sid=661fbbc1609037a8ec2e5f10e003f5a0
    |- (from above URL): open Device Manager, expand "Human Interface Devices",
          right click "XINPUT compatible HID device", "Update driver",
       "Browse my computer", "Let me pick". should be three options.
       Try "HID-compliant game controller". If you want to undo the
       change, same thing but update "HID-compliant game controller"
       and pick the XINPUT ***
- (updated) BINARY mode for IO now able to read signed vs. unsigned integers,
  specified using using .readtInt( flags ), where 'flags' is one of the above
  IO flags; in BINARY mode, IO.INT8/16/32 now returns unsigned integers, same as
  IO.UINT8/16/32; to read in signed two's complement integers, use the new
  IO.SINT8/16/32/64 flags
- (added) FileIO.readFloat( int flags) and FileIO.write( float val, int flags )
  these overloaded versions of readFloat() and write() respectively have a 'flags'

- (fixed) CNoise incorrect bias on pink noise (thank you anthonyhawes)
- (updated) on all platforms, Math.random*() functions now internally
  use a standard Mersenne Twister RNG (mt19937); this greatly improves 
  the quality of RNG output, especially on Windows
- (updated) on Linux, better default runtime driver selection for
  Jack and ALSA
- (updated/developer) chuck core minimum c++ level raised to c++11;
  projects need compile chuck core with earlier dialect of c++ would need
  to modify the source code accordingly
- (updated/developer) makefile for linux-jack
- (updated/developer) migrated RegEx module from base chuck to chugin
- (added/developer) DL Api array4 operations from chugin
- (added/developer) ChuckArray4::contains_object() returns whether
  array4 contains object references or integers

miniAudicle
- (updated) on Windows and Linux; miniAudicle now has a "Audio driver"
  drop-down selection in the Preferences dialog window; this selections
  allows for run-time selection of different drivers, e.g., "DirectSound",
  "WASAPI", or "ASIO" on Windows, as well as "Jack", "Pulse", or "ALSA" on
  Linux
- (fixed) miniAudicle linux compilation using Qt6

(HISTORICAL NOTE for ChAI)
Much of ChAI and its ways of thinking and doing can be foundationally
attributed to the work of Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink, her landmark Ph.D. Thesis,
/Real-time Human Interaction With Supervised Learning Algorithms for Music
Composition and Performance/ (2011) [1], the Wekinator framework [2], her
teaching at the intersections of AI, HCI, and Music [3], as well as earlier
collaborations between Rebecca and Ge [4,5] including SMIRK [6] (Small Musical
Information Retrieval toolKit; 2008; MARSYAS and the MIR work of Dr. George
Tzanetakis; early efforts in on-the-fly learning), the unit analyzer
framework [7] (2007; afford real-time audio feature extraction). All of
these have directly or indirectly contributed the creation of ChAI.
Additionally, ChAI benefitted from the teaching and design philosophy of
Dr. Perry R. Cook (Ph.D. advisor to Rebecca, George, and Ge at Princeton,
and ChucK co-author), who argued for real-time human interaction, parametric
sound synthesis, and the importance of play in the design of musical tools.

- (fixed) macOS bluetooth/Apple AirPods audio input device error;
    |- CONTEXT: Apple AirPods (and a number of other Bluetooth headphones) 
    show up in macOS as its own audio input device and supports only one 
    sample rate (24K in the case of AirPods). ChucK, like most full-duplex 
    audio software, requires matching sample rates for audio input and 
    output. By default, it would try to initialize with a sample rate of 
    44.1K or 48K and would fail initialization due to the rate mismatch 
    with the AirPods.
    |- FIX: ChucK now has additional logic when initializing default audio

- (fixed) Stk WvIn, WvOut, and VoicForm handling of chuck strings, 
    addressing related instability and averting potential crashes
- (fixed) Stk WvOut for MAT (MATLAB) format; previously closing a
    MAT file in WvOut results in an assertation failure; this has been
    addressed.
- (fixed) WvOut and WaveLoop playback for non-16bit data formats;
    previously was normalizing to 16-bit signed int, regardless of
    data format
- (updated and fixed) memory system upgrade (part 1); scope-sensitive
    cleanup for each return statement; clarified reference counting
    semantics; function argument release for builtin functions; improved
    post-function call object cleanup; auto-reference-increment on
    returned objects from all builtin/imported functions;
- (updated) built-in abstract classes FM, StkInstrmnt, BLT, and
    FilterBasic, when used directly, issues a WARNING level log
    message in their respective synthesis tick functions (set log
    level in chuck or miniAudicle to WARNING or higher to enable
    printing), and allows program to procede silently. (Example that
    previously crashed: 'FM fm => dac; 1::second => now;')
- (developer) Chugin API clients in C++ now able to create
    strings and access member variables (thanks Nick Shaheed!)
- (developer) Chugin API query now able to add examples using
    QUERY->add_ex(...)

-- a set of functionalities for interactive machine learning and artful, 
humanistic design of music and artificial intelligence; it coincides with 
the new "Music and AI" course at Stanford University, designed and taught 
by Ge Wang with Ph.D. candidate Yikai Li.

  - (added) MFCC unit analyzer (thanks Yikai Li)
        |- A unit analyzer that computes Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients
           (MFCCs), and outputs a vector of coefficients.

        mode, false if it's in silent mode (i.e. --silent is enabled)"
        -- thanks nshaheed --
  - (added) Machine.silent(): "return false if the shred is in realtime 
        mode, true if it's in silent mode (i.e. --silent is enabled)"
        -- thanks nshaheed --
  - (fixed) .help() now more accurately prints ("unit analyzer")
    for UAna types
  - (fixed) multi-variable array declaration; the following should
    now work:
        int x[1], y[2];
        int x, y[3];
  - (fixed) resolved an issue with multi-dimensional arrays pre-maturely
    releasing internal type data structure -- e.g., causing an assertion 
    failure in the second function call
        fun void test()
        {
            [ [1,2,3], [1,2,3] ] @=> int arr[][];
        }
        test();
        test();
  - (fixed) internal array storage now (more) correctly differentiate
    between int and float, on systems where the two are the same size
    (e.g., both 32-bit or both 64-bit)
  - (fixed) command line chuck: when opening default input audio device
        (e.g., Microphone), check for mono devices (the case on some MacOS
        systems) now happens earlier, before searching other 2-channel input
        audio devices; this preempts chuck using virtual audio input devices
        such as ZoomAudioDevice as the input device
  - (dev) added test examples in 01-Basic related to multi-var array
    declarations
  - (dev) extraneous white spaces removed throughout src/core

1.4.1.0 (June 2021)
---
(NOTE) chuck-1.4.1.0 is the first significant release resulting from a 
coordinated team effort to update and improve ChucK for teaching and 
research.  In April 2021, Perry and Ge led a ChucK "Global 
Repair-a-thon", which identified issues and put forth a new Development 
Roadmap. The ChucK dev team will follow this roadmap for updates, new 
features, and new ChucK mediums (e.g., Chunity, WebChucK, FaucK, 
ChucKTrip, and more). Many people were involved in this significant 
release, including Jack Atherton, Mike Mulshine, Matt Wright, Rebecca 
Fiebrink, Dan Trueman, Lloyd May, Mark Cerqueira, Mario Buoninfante, 
Perry Cook, Spencer Salazar, and Ge Wang.  Many thanks to everyone who 
contributed. Happy ChucKing!
---
  - (added) static Object.help();
    All ChucK objects (i.e., all non-primitive types) can now invoke 
    .help(), which will dynamically generate and print to console
    the description and inheritance hierarchy of the underlying type,
    as well as the available functions at runtime.  This can be called
    on any object instance or on any class (without an instance):
        // any object instance
        SinOsc foo;
        // print to console info about its underlying type
        foo.help();
        (OR)
        // call help() from any class (identical output as above)
        SinOsc.help();
    Intended to be a quick runtime reference / learning tool!
  - (added) examples/help.ck -- show .help() in action
  - (added) examples/deep/chant.ck (by Perry Cook, 2006) -- a chant singing
    synthesizer that makes use of ChucK's strongly-time and concurrent
    programming features.
  - (added) new Multi-channel LiSa UGens! (LiSa10 was already present)
        LiSa2 (stereo)
        LiSa4 (quad),
        LiSa6 (6-channel; laptop orchestra edition!)
        LiSa8 (8-channel),
        LiSa16 (16-channel)
  - (fixed) LiSa playback bug; voice panning now handles the mono case;
    previously was silencing voice playback
  - (added) new STK set/get access functions in FM:
        float op4Feedback( float value );
            Set operator 4 feedback.
        float op4Feedback();
            Get operator 4 feedback.
        float opADSR( int opNum, float a, float d, float s, float r );
            Set operator ADSR: attack, decay, sustain, release.
        float opAM( int opNum, float value );
            Set operator amplitude modulation.
        float opAM( int opNum );
            Get operator amplitude modulation.
        float opGain( int opNum, float value );
            Set operator gain.
        float opGain( int opNum );
            Get gperator gain.
        float opRatio( int opNum, float ratio );
            Set operator frequency ratio.
        float opRatio( int opNum );
            Get operator frequency ratio.
        float opWave( int opNum, int wave );
            Set operator waveform [1-8].
  - (added) new Synthesis Toolkit (STK) FM instruments from Perry!
        HnkyTonk: STK-style Honkey Tonk Piano FM synthesis instrument.
            (aka, Algorithm 1 of the Yamaha TX81Z DX11 FM synthesizer)
        FrencHrn: STK-style French Horn FM synthesis instrument.
            (aka, Algorithm 2 of the Yamaha TX81Z DX11 FM synthesizer)
        KrstlChr: STK-style "Crystal Choir" FM synthesis instrument.
            (aka, Algorithm 7 of the Yamaha TX81Z DX11 FM synthesizer)
    *** for each of these, try using the new .help() to examine its
    documentation and interface; e.g., HnkyTonk.help(); ***
  - (added) new Moog function:
        float filterStartFreq( float freq );
            Set filter starting frequency.
        float filterStartFreq();
            Get filter starting frequency.
  - (added) new STK examples:
        examples/stk/frenchrn-algo2.ck -- FM French Horn demo
        examples/stk/honkeytonk-algo1.ck -- fun with FM Honkey Tonk
        examples/stk/krstlchr-algo7.ck -- heavenly FM Kristal Choir
        examples/stk/hevymetl-acoustic-algo3.ck -- FM HevyMetl => Nylon Guitar
        examples/stk/hevymetl-trumpet-algo3.ck -- FM HevyMetl => Trumpet
        examples/stk/rhodey-song.ck -- a lovely little number
  - (updated) tweaks to a number of STK UGens, which may result in audio
    changes; the affected UGens are:
        BandedWG, BeeThree, FMVoices, HevyMetl, PercFlut, Rhodey,
        TubeBell, Wurley
  - (fixed) issue in PluckTwo in computing delay length; this affects
    the tuning of various plucked string models, including Mandolin.
  - (added) .frames() for SndBuf and SndBuf2; returns the number of sample
    frames in the loaded sound file. This is identical in behavior to
    .samples() -- but for stereo+, .frames() is semanitically more 
    accurate than .samples().
  - (added) "global" declarations for int, float, string, Object, UGen, Event;
    this can be used in-language across ChucK files (each file must first 
    "declare" the global value before using it). This also support usage from
    external hosts such as Chunity. (thanks to Jack Atherton for this work!)
  - (added) constant power panning (as controlled by the .pan parameter)
    for all UGen_Stereo--including Pan2, stereo dac, stereo adc; this is
    controllable using the new .panType parameter.  By default, constant
    power panning is NOT enabled for dac and adc, whose panning behavior 
    is unchanged (panType==0) and favors a kind of unity-gain-preserving
    but perceptually suspect panning scheme. By contrast, Pan2 will default
    to use constant power panning (panType==1).  This change will alter the
    effect of any existing code that uses Pan2.  Specifically, it will
    introduce a ~3 dB reduction in the output Pan2 (it is possible to
    restore the previous behavior by explicitly setting .panType to 0). 
    This ~3 dB reduction corresponds to the equal-powered amplitude value
    when pan is at center (pan=0). Mathematically, the reduction amount 
    can be calculated using Std.lintodb(Math.cos(pi/4))
    [To hear this new behavior, check out examples/stereo/stereo_noise.ck]
  - (BEHAVIOR CHANGED) clearly separated array.size() and array.capacity();
    for historical/compatibility reasons, array.cap() is the same as
    array.size() and generally should be avoided in favor of either .size()
    or .capacity()
  - (BEHAVIOR CHANGED): internally, all ChucK static functions are now
    passed an extra parameter (Chuck_Type * TYPE) as a pointer to the
    base type/class. This will affect Chugins, which should be updated/
    rebuilt with the latest headers.
  - (BEHAVIOR CHANGED): when connecting two multi-channel UGen's (both
    are at least stereo), say LHS => RHS, if LHS channels < RHS channels,
    the channels will be connected one-by-one up to the LHS channel count;
    previously, the LHS channels will be automatically repeated to connect
    to the RHS channels that have no corresponding LHS channels.  This
    behavior can still be achieved by manually connecting the individual
    channels of LHS and and RHS through LHS.chan(n) and RHS.chan(n).
  - (fixed) resolved a bug with SndBuf not playing when .rate < 0 and while
    .pos beyond the end
  - (fixed) resolved a bug with SndBuf where it could output DC when .rate < 0
    after it reaches the beginning of the file (e.g., if the first sample is
    non-zero)
  - (fixed) resolved a bug in ADSR when sustain is set to 0 and audio stops,
    .releaseTime return NaN and basically the world ends (thanks to
    mariobuoninfante for help in addressing this)
  - (fixed) reset Gen10 table to allow add/remove partials; thanks to 
    mariobuoninfant
  - (fixed) updated MidiOut and removed check in order to allow messages
    of size less than or greater than 3 bytes; thanks to mariobuoninfante
    for this issue report on Ubuntu Studio 64-bit; this fix addresses
    the sending of MIDI clock, stop, continue, and SysEx -- also thank 
    you mariobuoninfante for the fix.
  - (fixed) ChucK shell can now be exited either by the "exit" command
    or through ctrl-c.  Previously. ctrl-c sometimes failed to end the
    the program due to logic in the global cleanup function; this has
    been addressed.
  - (fixed) addressed an issue where Chugins were being loaded twice.
  - (fixed) the --chugin-load:off option is now correclty taken into
    account and will appropriately result in no Chugins being loaded.
  - (deprecated) Chubgraph => (new) Chugraph;
    Chubgraph will continue to function, with a deprecation warning.
  - (documentation) updated embedded documentation text for all statically
    linked UGens and libraries.
  - (documentation) brought examples in alignment between distribution
    and the online examples collection; many examples updated for clarity
    and utility
        http://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/examples
        http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/examples
  - (internal/refactor) the "Mega Merge 2021" integrates a long-standing
    branch since REFACTOR-2017 that includes support for globals and was
    the basis for Chunity.  Future Chunity releases will align with mainline
    ChucK language features. (thanks to Jack Atherton for several years of
    laying the groundwork and for ChucK in Chunity!)
  - (internal/developement) added m_started flag to the ChucK class to avoid
    a strange (but mostly harmless) condition when the virtual machine is
    shutting down and ChucK::run() attempt to call ChucK::start()
  - (internal/development) Thanks to Mark Cerqueira -- migrated from old
    Travis CI (continuous integration testing) to GHA (GitHub Actions).


1.4.0.1 (May 2020)
---
  - (fixed) when opening audio input devices where the default
    device has insufficient chanels (e.g., MacOS input is mono
    by default), logic has been added to also match sample rates
    when searching for alternate audio input devices;  additional
    logic added in the specific case of mono input devices to
    simulate stereo, to fulfill the standard request for stereo
    input.
  - (fixed) added check to prevent crash in rare situations involving
    self-join when deleting XThread in background. (git PR #103)
  - (fixed) by stuntgoat@github -- right-recursion in chuck parser
    can exhaust memory in larger chuck files; this has been updated
    to use left recursion.  (git PR #32, (finally) merged by hand by 
    Spencer and Ge)  Also thanks to Tom Lieber for the initial analysis
    and solution:
    https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/chuck-users/2009-April/004029.html
  - (added) by Nathan Tindall -- Q and freq bounding for filters (LPF,
    HPF, BPF, BRF) to avoid LOUD FILTER EXPLOSIONS; now negative values
    will throw an exception on the offending shred.
  - (restored, macOS) MAUI Chugin now (re)supported, post 1.4.0.0
  - (added; developer) ChucK.h API to set a main thread hook (e.g., for 
    graphical functionalitie from Chugins)
  - (updated, developer) Chugin API now support main thread callback
    for graphical-/GUI purposes
  - (developer) refactored code to move I/O-related code out of
    chuck_lang and into chuck_io.

            ugens, and mono unit ugens
            ex. 
                SinOsc s => Pan2 pan => Gain master[2] => dac;
            persists stereo signal through master to dac. 
            See examples/stereo/array.ck for example usage. 
  - (added) new OSC support classes
            - OscOut
              Sends OSC messages
                - .dest(string host, int port)
                  set destination hostname or IP address and port

                - .removeAddress(string addr)
                  stop listening for OSC addresses matching addr
                - .listenAll()
                  listen for all incoming OSC messages on port
                - int .recv(OscMsg msg)
                  retrieve pending OSC messages into msg. Returns 1 if a 
                  message was available, 0 otherwise

---
  - (added) chuck now automatically detects and uses next highest
            or closest (in that order) system sample rate in   
            the case where the default is not available; if a sample
            rate requested via --srate: is not available, an error
            will be encountered with a message.
  - (fixed) base parent object is correctly accounted for by

            reporting and narrowing this down)
  - (fixed) opening real-time audio with 0 input channels should
            now work, once again.


1.3.1.1 (September 2012)
---
  - (fixed) critical bug since 1.3 where member function calls in
            loop conditionals caused crashes when the loop body
            contained local Object's to be released;  this directly
            affects using OSC, MIDI, HID, which commonly employ 
            syntax like: 'while( e.nextMesg() ) { ... }';
            -- this is most likely the cause of the OSC-related issues
            we've been seeing (thanks to Graham Coleman for tracking 
            down and narrowingthe issue!)
  - (fixed) strengthened synchronization in OSC between internal
            listener thread and chuck VM code
  - (fixed) memory bug in OscRecv deallocation
  - (fixed) Machine.add( ... ) on windows now supports both '\\'
            and '/' in aboslute paths (previously only '\\').

            the existing Std.rand*() and Std.srand() is still
            be available for compatibility (these to be deprecated
            in the future; please start using Math.random*())
            * (NOTE: on windows, Math.random() still uses the same
              generator as Std.rand() -- we hope to improve this in
              a future version!)

            * Math.i or Math.I or Math.j or Math.J // as 'complex' type
            * Math.INFINITY
            * Math.RANDOM_MAX
            * Math.INT_MAX // currently, differs on 32-bit and 64-bit systems
            * Math.FLOAT_MAX
            * Math.FLOAT_MIN_MAG // minimum positive float value
  - (fixed) Chubgraph.gain(), .last(), and .op()

1.2.0.3 (October 2005)
---
  (API changes again)
  (syntax change - 'loop' -> 'repeat')
  - loop( ... ) construct (see 1.2.0.2) changed to repeat( ... )
    - usage and semantics same as before
    - this is also an experimental language feature
      (let us know if it's good or bad)
  - float std.abs( float ) changed -> int std.abs( int )
  - use std.fabs( ... ) for floating point absolute value

  - (added) /* block comments */
    - no nesting allowed
    - closing '*/' not necessary if commenting out rest of the file
  - (fixed) arrays of null object references correctly allocated
      : Event @ events[128];
  - (fixed) DEFAULT sndbuf rate now set correctly to interpolate
      for files outside of chuck sample rate (no longer have to
      explicit do 1 => buf.rate)

      unnecessary events...
  - (changed) examples/stk/wurley.ck -> examples/stk/wurley2.ck

1.2.0.2 (2005.10.17)
---
  (sorry for the API changes)
  - (API change) OSC_Send class name changed to 'OscSend'
      (also): .startMesg(...) name changed to startMsg(...)
  - (API change) OSC_Recv class name changed to 'OscRecv'
  - (API change) OSC_Addr class name changed to 'OscEvent'
      (also): .hasMesg() name changed to .hasMsg()
      (also): .nextMesg() name changed to .nextMsg()
  - (API change) STK Shakers.freq now expect Hz instead of MIDI number

  - (moved) examples/event/opensound*.ck moved to examples/osc/OSC*.ck
      (see OSC_send.ck and OSC_recv.ck for examples on OpenSoundControl)
  - (moved) examples/event/polyfony*.ck to examples/midi/

  - (added) 'loop(...){ }' control structure : 
      example: loop( 8 ) { ... } // executes body 8 times
      example: loop( foo ) { ... } // executes body foo times
      (foo is evaluated exactly once entering the loop, the
      value at that time is used as a constant to control
      loop iteration - even if foo is changed in the loop
      body.)
      - supports break and continue
      - important: one fundamantal difference between the loop 
        semantic and for/while/until semantic is that the argument

      terminal 1%> chuck --loop
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_01.ck
      (wait)
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_02.ck
