## Strongly-timed, Concurrent, and On-the-fly Music Programming Language  

Welcome to ChucK! 

what is it? : Chuck is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation. It is open-source and freely available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Chuck presents a unique time-based, concurrent programming model that's precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), with dynamic control rates and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It's fun and easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive music.
