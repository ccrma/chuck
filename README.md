# ChucK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ccrma/chuck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ccrma/chuck)
## Strongly-timed, Concurrent, and On-the-fly Music Programming Language  

This is a custom fork of ChucK for use in [ruckus](https://github.com/tonal-glyph/ruckus). All attempts will be made to keep it compiling and compatible with 1.4.0.0 API. That being said, I may crazily refactor this to my own liking.

Welcome to ChucK! 

what is it? : ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation. It is open-source and freely available on MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. ChucK presents a unique time-based, concurrent programming model that's precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It's fun and easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive music.
