\section{Using OSC in ChucK} 
\textbf{by Rebecca Fiebrink}\\

\section*{To send OSC:}
Host\\ 
Decide on a host to send the messages to. E.g., "splash.local" if sending to computer named "Splash," or "localhost" to send to the same machine that is sending. 

Port\\ 
Decide on a port to which the messages will be sent. This is an integer, like 1234. 

Message "address" \\ 
For each type of message you're sending, decide on a way to identify this type of message, formatted like a web URL e.g., "conductor/downbeat/beat1" or "Rebecca/message1" 

Message contents \\
Decide on whether the message will contain data, which can be 0 or more ints, floats, strings, or any combination of them. 

For each sender: 
\begin{verbatim}
//Create an OscSend object: 
OscSend xmit; 
//Set the host and port of this object: 
xmit.setHost("localhost", 1234); 
\end{verbatim}

For every message, start the message by supplying the address and format of contents, where "f" stands for float, "i" stands for int, and "s" stands for string: 
\begin{verbatim}
//To send a message with no contents: 
xmit.startMsg("conductor/downbeat"); 
//To send a message with one integer: 
xmit.startMsg("conductor/downbeat, i"); 
//To send a message with a float, an int, and another float: 
xmit.startMsg("conductor/downbeat, f, i, f"); 
\end{verbatim}

For every piece of information in the contents of each message, add this information to the message: 
\begin{verbatim}
//to add an int: 
xmit.addInt(10); 
//to add a float: 
xmit.addFloat(10.); 
//to add a string: 
xmit.addString("abc"); 
\end{verbatim}

Once all parts of the message have been added, the message will automatically be sent.

\textbf{To receive OSC: }

Port: \\
Decide what port to listen on. This must be the same as the port the sender is using. Message address and format of contents: This must also be the same as what the sender is using; i.e., the same as in the sender's startMsg function. 

Code: for each receiver 
\begin{verbatim}
//Create an OscRecv object: 
OscRecv orec; 
//Tell the OscRecv object the port: 
1234 => orec.port; 
//Tell the OscRecv object to start listening for OSC messages on that port: 
orec.listen(); 
\end{verbatim}

For each type of message, create an event that will be used to wait on that type of message, using the same argument as the sender's startMsg function: e.g., 

\begin{verbatim}
orec.event("conductor/downbeat, i") @=> OscEvent myDownbeat; 
\end{verbatim}

To wait on an OSC message that matches the message type used for a particular event e, do 
\begin{verbatim}
e => now; 
\end{verbatim}

(just like waiting for regular Events in chuck) 

To process the message: Grab the message out of the queue (mandatory!) 

e.nextMsg(); 
For every piece of information in the message, get the data out. You must call these functions in order, according to your formatting string used above. 
\begin{verbatim}
e.getInt() => int i; 
e.getFloat() => float f; 
e.getString() => string s; 
\end{verbatim}

If you expect you may receive more than one message for an event at once, you should process every message waiting in the cue: 

\begin{verbatim}
while (e.nextMsg() != 0) 
{ 
	//process message here (no need to call nextMsg again 
}
\end{verbatim}
