This object contains results associated with UAna analysis.  There is a
UAnaBlob associated with every UAna.  As a UAna is upchucked, the result
is stored in the UAnaBlob's floating point vector and/or complex vector.
The intended interpretation of the results depends on the specific UAna.
This UAna computes the Fast Fourier Transform on incoming audio samples,
and outputs the result via its UAnaBlob as both the complex spectrum and
the magnitude spectrum.  A buffering mechanism maintains the previous
FFTsize # of samples, allowing FFT's to be taken at any point in time,
on demand (via .upchuck() or by upchucking a downstream UAna;
The window size (along with an arbitry window shape) is controlled
via the .window method. The hop size is completely dynamic, and is throttled
by how time is advanced.
