This UAna computes the Discrete Cosine Transform on incoming audio
samples, and outputs the result via its UAnaBlob as real values in the
D.C. spectrum.  A buffering mechanism maintains the previous DCT size #
of samples, allowing DCT to be taken at any point in time, on demand (via
.upchuck() or by upchucking a downstream UAna; The window size (along
with an arbitry window shape) is controlled via the .window method. The
hop size is complete dynamic, and is throttled by how time is advanced.
