    This class provides input support for various
    audio file formats.  It also serves as a base
    class for "realtime" streaming subclasses.

    WvIn loads the contents of an audio file for
    subsequent output.  Linear interpolation is
    used for fractional "read rates".

    WvIn supports multi-channel data in interleaved
    format.  It is important to distinguish the
    tick() methods, which return samples produced
    by averaging across sample frames, from the 
    tickFrame() methods, which return pointers to
    multi-channel sample frames.  For single-channel
    data, these methods return equivalent values.

    Small files are completely read into local memory
    during instantiation.  Large files are read
    incrementally from disk.  The file size threshold
    and the increment size values are defined in
    WvIn.h.

    WvIn currently supports WAV, AIFF, SND (AU),
    MAT-file (Matlab), and STK RAW file formats.
    Signed integer (8-, 16-, and 32-bit) and floating-
    point (32- and 64-bit) data types are supported.
    Uncompressed data types are not supported.  If
    using MAT-files, data should be saved in an array
    with each data channel filling a matrix row.
