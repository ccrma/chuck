    This class provides output support for various
    audio file formats.  It also serves as a base
    class for "realtime" streaming subclasses.

    WvOut writes samples to an audio file.  It
    supports multi-channel data in interleaved
    format.  It is important to distinguish the
    tick() methods, which output single samples
    to all channels in a sample frame, from the
    tickFrame() method, which takes a pointer
    to multi-channel sample frame data.

    WvOut currently supports WAV, AIFF, AIFC, SND
    (AU), MAT-file (Matlab), and STK RAW file
    formats.  Signed integer (8-, 16-, and 32-bit)
    and floating- point (32- and 64-bit) data types
    are supported.  STK RAW files use 16-bit
    integers by definition.  MAT-files will always
    be written as 64-bit floats.  If a data type
    specification does not match the specified file
    type, the data type will automatically be
    modified.  Uncompressed data types are not
    supported.

    Currently, WvOut is non-interpolating and the
    output rate is always Stk::sampleRate().
