This class uses banded waveguide techniques to     
model a variety of sounds, including bowed     
bars, glasses, and bowls.  For more     
information, see Essl, G. and Cook, P. "Banded     
Waveguides: Towards Physical Modelling of Bar     
Percussion Instruments", Proceedings of the     
1999 International Computer Music Conference.
