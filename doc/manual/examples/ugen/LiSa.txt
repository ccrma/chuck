    LiSa provides basic live sampling functionality.  An internal
    buffer stores samples chucked to LiSa's input.  Segments of
    this buffer can be played back, with ramping and speed/direction
    control.  Multiple voice facility is built in, allowing for a
    single LiSa object to serve as a source for sample layering and
    granular textures.  by Dan Trueman (2007) see LiSa Examples
