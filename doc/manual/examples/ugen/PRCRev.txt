    This class is based on some of the famous
    Stanford/CCRMA reverbs (NRev, KipRev), which
    were based on the Chowning/Moorer/Schroeder
    reverberators using networks of simple allpass
    and comb delay filters.  This class implements
    two series allpass units and two parallel comb
    filters.
