    This class implements a simple clarinet
    physical model, as discussed by Smith (1986),
    McIntyre, Schumacher, Woodhouse (1983), and
    others.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford
    University, Yamaha, and others.

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Reed Stiffness = 2
       - Noise Gain = 4
       - Vibrato Frequency = 11
       - Vibrato Gain = 1
       - Breath Pressure = 128
