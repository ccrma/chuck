Ported from rtcmix. See http://www.music.columbia.edu/cmix/makegens.html
for more information on the GenX family of UGens. Currently coefficients
past the 100th are ignored.

Lookup can either be done using the lookup() function, or by driving the
table with an input UGen, typically a Phasor. For an input signal
between [ -1, 1 ], using the absolute value for [ -1, 0 ], GenX will
output the table value indexed by the current input.
