Constructs a lookup table composed of sequential line segments. For a
table with N lines, starting value of y', and value y_n for lookup index
x_n , set the coefficients to [ y', y_0 , x_0 , ..., y_N-1 , x_N-1 ].
Note that there must be an odd number of coefficients. If an even number
of coefficients is specified, behavior is undefined. The sum of x_n for
0 ? n < N must be 1.
