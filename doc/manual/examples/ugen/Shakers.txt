    PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event    Modeling) is an algorithmic approach for    simulating collisions of multiple independent    sound producing objects.  This class is a    meta-model that can simulate a Maraca, Sekere,    Cabasa, Bamboo Wind Chimes, Water Drops,    Tambourine, Sleighbells, and a Guiro.    PhOLIES (Physically-Oriented Library of    Imitated Environmental Sounds) is a similar    approach for the synthesis of environmental    sounds.  This class implements simulations of    breaking sticks, crunchy snow (or not), a    wrench, sandpaper, and more.    Control Change Numbers:        - Shake Energy = 2       - System Decay = 4       - Number Of Objects = 11       - Resonance Frequency = 1       - Shake Energy = 128       - Instrument Selection = 1071        - Maraca = 0        - Cabasa = 1        - Sekere = 2        - Guiro = 3        - Water Drops = 4        - Bamboo Chimes = 5        - Tambourine = 6        - Sleigh Bells = 7        - Sticks = 8        - Crunch = 9        - Wrench = 10        - Sand Paper = 11        - Coke Can = 12        - Next Mug = 13        - Penny + Mug = 14        - Nickle + Mug = 15        - Dime + Mug = 16        - Quarter + Mug = 17        - Franc + Mug = 18        - Peso + Mug = 19        - Big Rocks = 20        - Little Rocks = 21        - Tuned Bamboo Chimes = 22    by Perry R.
