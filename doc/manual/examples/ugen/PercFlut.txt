    This class implements algorithm 4 of the TX81Z.

    \code
    Algorithm 4 is :   4->3--\
                          2-- + -->1-->Out
    \endcode

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Total Modulator Index = 2
       - Modulator Crossfade = 4
       - LFO Speed = 11
       - LFO Depth = 1
       - ADSR 2 & 4 Target = 128

    The basic Chowning/Stanford FM patent expired
    in 1995, but there exist follow-on patents,
    mostly assigned to Yamaha.  If you are of the
    type who should worry about this (making
    money) worry away.
