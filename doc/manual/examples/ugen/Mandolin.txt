    This class inherits from PluckTwo and uses
    "commuted synthesis" techniques to model a
    mandolin instrument.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by
    Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.
    Commuted Synthesis, in particular, is covered
    by patents, granted, pending, and/or
    applied-for.  All are assigned to the Board of
    Trustees, Stanford University.  For
    information, contact the Office of Technology
    Licensing, Stanford University.
