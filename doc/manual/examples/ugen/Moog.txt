    This instrument uses one attack wave, one
    looped wave, and an ADSR envelope (inherited
    from the Sampler class) and adds two sweepable
    formant (FormSwep) filters.

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Filter Q = 2
       - Filter Sweep Rate = 4
       - Vibrato Frequency = 11
       - Vibrato Gain = 1
       - Gain = 128
