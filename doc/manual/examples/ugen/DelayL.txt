    This Delay subclass implements a fractional-
    length digital delay-line using first-order
    linear interpolation.  A fixed maximum length
    of 4095 and a delay of zero is set using the
    default constructor.  Alternatively, the
    delay and maximum length can be set during
    instantiation with an overloaded constructor.

    Linear interpolation is an efficient technique
    for achieving fractional delay lengths, though
    it does introduce high-frequency signal
    attenuation to varying degrees depending on the
    fractional delay setting.  The use of higher
    order Lagrange interpolators can typically
    improve (minimize) this attenuation characteristic.
