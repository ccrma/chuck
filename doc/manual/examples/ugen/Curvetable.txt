Constructs a wavetable composed of segments of variable times, values,
and curvatures. Coefficients are specified as a single linear array of
triplets of [ time, value, curvature ] followed by a final duple of [
time, value ] to specify the final value of the table. time values are
expressed in unitless, ascending values. For curvature equal to 0, the
segment is a line; for curvature less than 0, the segment is a convex
curve; for curvature greater than 0, the segment is a concave curve.
