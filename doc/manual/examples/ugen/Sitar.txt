    This class implements a sitar plucked string
    physical model based on the Karplus-Strong
    algorithm.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by
    Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.
    There exist at least two patents, assigned to
    Stanford, bearing the names of Karplus and/or
    Strong.
