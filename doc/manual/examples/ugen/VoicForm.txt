    This instrument contains an excitation singing
    wavetable (looping wave with random and
    periodic vibrato, smoothing on frequency,
    etc.), excitation noise, and four sweepable
    complex resonances.

    Measured formant data is included, and enough
    data is there to support either parallel or
    cascade synthesis.  In the floating point case
    cascade synthesis is the most natural so
    that's what you'll find here.

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Voiced/Unvoiced Mix = 2
       - Vowel/Phoneme Selection = 4
       - Vibrato Frequency = 11
       - Vibrato Gain = 1
       - Loudness (Spectral Tilt) = 128
