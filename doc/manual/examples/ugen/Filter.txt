    This class implements a generic structure which
    can be used to create a wide range of filters.
    It can function independently or be subclassed
    to provide more specific controls based on a
    particular filter type.

    In particular, this class implements the standard
    difference equation:

    a[0]*y[n] = b[0]*x[n] + ... + b[nb]*x[n-nb] -
                a[1]*y[n-1] - ... - a[na]*y[n-na]

    If a[0] is not equal to 1, the filter coeffcients
    are normalized by a[0].

    The \e gain parameter is applied at the filter
    input and does not affect the coefficient values.
    The default gain value is 1.0.  This structure
    results in one extra multiply per computed sample,
    but allows easy control of the overall filter gain.
