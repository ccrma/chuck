    This class is derived from the CLM NRev
    function, which is based on the use of
    networks of simple allpass and comb delay
    filters.  This particular arrangement consists
    of 6 comb filters in parallel, followed by 3
    allpass filters, a lowpass filter, and another
    allpass in series, followed by two allpass
    filters in parallel with corresponding right
    and left outputs.
