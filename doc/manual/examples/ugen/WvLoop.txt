    This class inherits from WvIn and provides
    audio file looping functionality.

    WaveLoop supports multi-channel data in
    interleaved format.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() methods, which return
    samples produced by averaging across sample
    frames, from the tickFrame() methods, which
    return pointers to multi-channel sample frames.
    For single-channel data, these methods return
    equivalent values.
