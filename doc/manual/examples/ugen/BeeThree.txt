    This class implements a simple 4 operator
    topology, also referred to as algorithm 8 of
    the TX81Z.

    \code
    Algorithm 8 is :
                     1 --.
                     2 -\|
                         +-> Out
                     3 -/|
                     4 --
    \endcode

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Operator 4 (feedback) Gain = 2
       - Operator 3 Gain = 4
       - LFO Speed = 11
       - LFO Depth = 1
       - ADSR 2 & 4 Target = 128

    The basic Chowning/Stanford FM patent expired
    in 1995, but there exist follow-on patents,
    mostly assigned to Yamaha.  If you are of the
    type who should worry about this (making
    money) worry away.
