    This Delay subclass implements a fractional-
    length digital delay-line using a first-order
    allpass filter.  A fixed maximum length
    of 4095 and a delay of 0.5 is set using the
    default constructor.  Alternatively, the
    delay and maximum length can be set during
    instantiation with an overloaded constructor.

    An allpass filter has unity magnitude gain but
    variable phase delay properties, making it useful
    in achieving fractional delays without affecting
    a signal's frequency magnitude response.  In
    order to achieve a maximally flat phase delay
    response, the minimum delay possible in this
    implementation is limited to a value of 0.5.
