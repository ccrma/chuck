    This class implements a simple plucked string
    algorithm (Karplus Strong) with enhancements
    (Jaffe-Smith, Smith, and others), including
    string stiffness and pluck position controls.
    The stiffness is modeled with allpass filters.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by
    Stanford University, Yamaha, and others.

    Control Change Numbers:
       - Pickup Position = 4
       - String Sustain = 11
       - String Stretch = 1
