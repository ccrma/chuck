    This class implements 3 carriers and a common
    modulator, also referred to as algorithm 6 of
    the TX81Z.

    \code
    Algorithm 6 is :
                        /->1 -\
                     4-|-->2 - +-> Out
                        \->3 -/
    \endcode

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Vowel = 2
       - Spectral Tilt = 4
       - LFO Speed = 11
       - LFO Depth = 1
       - ADSR 2 & 4 Target = 128

    The basic Chowning/Stanford FM patent expired
    in 1995, but there exist follow-on patents,
    mostly assigned to Yamaha.  If you are of the
    type who should worry about this (making
    money) worry away.
