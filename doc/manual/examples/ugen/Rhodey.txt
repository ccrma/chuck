           synthesis instrument.

    This class implements two simple FM Pairs
    summed together, also referred to as algorithm
    5 of the TX81Z.

    \code
    Algorithm 5 is :  4->3--\
                             + --> Out
                      2->1--/
    \endcode

    Control Change Numbers: 
       - Modulator Index One = 2
       - Crossfade of Outputs = 4
       - LFO Speed = 11
       - LFO Depth = 1
       - ADSR 2 & 4 Target = 128

    The basic Chowning/Stanford FM patent expired
    in 1995, but there exist follow-on patents,
    mostly assigned to Yamaha.  If you are of the
    type who should worry about this (making
    money) worry away.
