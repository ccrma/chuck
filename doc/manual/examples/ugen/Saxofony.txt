    This class implements a "hybrid" digital
    waveguide instrument that can generate a
    variety of wind-like sounds.  It has also been
    referred to as the "blowed string" model.  The
    waveguide section is essentially that of a
    string, with one rigid and one lossy
    termination.  The non-linear function is a
    reed table.  The string can be "blown" at any
    point between the terminations, though just as
    with strings, it is impossible to excite the
    system at either end.  If the excitation is
    placed at the string mid-point, the sound is
    that of a clarinet.  At points closer to the
    "bridge", the sound is closer to that of a
    saxophone.  See Scavone (2002) for more details.

    This is a digital waveguide model, making its
    use possibly subject to patents held by Stanford
    University, Yamaha, and others.

    Control Change Numbers:
