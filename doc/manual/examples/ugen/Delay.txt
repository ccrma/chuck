    This protected Filter subclass implements
    a non-interpolating digital delay-line.
    A fixed maximum length of 4095 and a delay
    of zero is set using the default constructor.
    Alternatively, the delay and maximum length
    can be set during instantiation with an
    overloaded constructor.
    
    A non-interpolating delay line is typically
    used in fixed delay-length applications, such
    as for reverberation.
