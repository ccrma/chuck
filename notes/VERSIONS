---
  - (added) chuck now automatically detects and uses next highest
            or closest (in that order) system sample rate in   
            the case where the default is not available; if a sample
            rate requested via --srate: is not available, an error
            will be encountered with a message.
  - (fixed) base parent object is correctly accounted for by 
            new shred when sporking member functions
            (thanks to Michael Heuer for reporting and 
             narrowing this down)
  - (fixed) popping local variables from the operand stack in cases
            where the datatype size is larger than int-size; this
            is a bug introduced with 64-bit in 1.3.1.0, and exhibited
            on 32-bit systems only.  (thanks to Simon Steptoe 
            reporting and narrowing this down)
  - (fixed) opening real-time audio with 0 input channels should
            now work, once again.

1.3.1.1
---
  - (fixed) critical bug since 1.3 where member function calls in
            loop conditionals caused crashes when the loop body
            contained local Object's to be released;  this directly
            affects using OSC, MIDI, HID, which commonly employ 
            syntax like: 'while( e.nextMesg() ) { ... }';
            -- this is most likely the cause of the OSC-related issues
            we've been seeing (thanks to Graham Coleman for tracking 
            down and narrowingthe issue!)
  - (fixed) strengthened synchronization in OSC between internal
            listener thread and chuck VM code
  - (fixed) memory bug in OscRecv deallocation
  - (fixed) Machine.add( ... ) on windows now supports both '\\'
            and '/' in aboslute paths (previously only '\\').
            (thanks to Graham Coleman for finding this!)

            and Math.RANDOM_MAX;  NOTE: randomf() returns range 0.0 to 1.0
            these use the much better random() stdlib functions
            the existing Std.rand*() and Std.srand() is still
            be available for compatibility (these to be deprecated
            in the future; please start using Math.random*())
            * (NOTE: on windows, Math.random() still uses the same
              generator as Std.rand() -- we hope to improve this in
              a future version!)
            * (NOTE: also see removed below)

  - (added) examples/array/array_mmixed.ck to verify mixed-index
            fix (see below), based on Robin Haberkorn's test code
  - (fixed) multi-dimensional arrays now correctly support mix-typed
            indices (e.g., strings & ints) (thanks Robin Haberkorn)
  - (fixed) constants in Math library now cleaner, they include:
            * Math.PI
            * Math.TWO_PI
            * Math.e or Math.E
            * Math.i or Math.I or Math.j or Math.J // as 'complex' type
            * Math.INFINITY
            * Math.RANDOM_MAX
            * Math.INT_MAX // currently, differs on 32-bit and 64-bit systems
            * Math.FLOAT_MAX
            * Math.FLOAT_MIN_MAG // minimum positive float value
  - (fixed) Chubgraph.gain(), .last(), and .op()
  - (fixed) error message printing system for variable arguments
  - (fixed) StifKarp.sustain now works properly
  - (fixed) all examples now use Math.random*() instead of Std.rand*()
  - (removed) Math.rand*() removed --> please use Math.random*();
            (see 'added' above; Std.rand*() still there, but to be 
            deprecated; please use Math.random*() moving forward)

1.2.0.3
  (API changes again)
  (syntax change - 'loop' -> 'repeat')

    - usage and semantics same as before
    - this is also an experimental language feature

  - (added) 'loop(...){ }' control structure : 
      example: loop( 8 ) { ... } // executes body 8 times

      value at that time is used as a constant to control
      loop iteration - even if foo is changed in the loop
      body.)
      - supports break and continue
      - important: one fundamantal difference between the loop

        expression 'exp' in loop( exp ) is evaluated exactly once
        when the loop is first entered.

      terminal 1%> chuck --loop
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_01.ck
      (wait)
      terminal 2%> chuck + otf_02.ck
