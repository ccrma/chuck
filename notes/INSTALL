We tried to make ChucK as easy as possible to build and re-use. All 
sources files - headers source for compiler, vm, and audio engine - are 
in the same directory (they run in the same address space anyway). Platforms 
differences are abstracted to the lowest level (in part thanks to Gary 
Scavone). None of the compiler/vm has any OS-depedent code. To build 
chuck from the source (from scratch): 

---
1. Go to the src/ directory (replace chuck-x.x.x.x with the actual 
directory name):

   %> cd chuck-x.x.x.x/src/

---
2. If you type 'make' here, you should get the following message:

   %> make
   [chuck build]: please use one of the following configurations:
       make osx, make osx-ub, make win32,
       make linux-oss, make linux-alsa, or make linux-jack

Now, type the command corresponding to your platform... 

for example, for macOS (Universal Binary: Intel + Apple Silicon):

   %> make mac-ub

or for macOS (current):

   %> make mac

etc...

---
3. If you like to install chuck (cp into /usr/local/bin by default).
If you would like a different destination, edit the makefile under 'install',
or skip this step altogether. (we recommend putting it somewhere in your 
path, it makes on-the-fly programming easier)

   %> make install

---
4. If you haven't gotten any egregous error messages up to this point, 
then you should be done! There should be a 'chuck' executable in the 
current directory. For a quick sanity check, execute the following (use 
'./chuck' if chuck is not in your path), and see if you get the same output:

   %> chuck
   [chuck]: no input files...

(if you do get error messages during compilation, or you run into some 
other problem - please let us know and we will do our best to provide 
support) 

---
5. You are ready to ChucK. If this is your first time programming in 
ChucK, you may want to look at the documentation, or take the ChucK 
Tutorial (in doc/ and online http://chuck.stanford.edu/doc/). ThanK 
you very much. Go forth and happy ChucKin'!
