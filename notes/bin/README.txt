If you are using the executable, you may want to put chuck (osx) or 
chuck.exe (win32) in your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin)

On MacOS X (using Terminal): go to the bin/ directory and type:

    sudo cp chuck /usr/bin/
    (enter your password when prompted)

    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/chuck
    (now you can run chuck from any directory using Terminal)

On win32: put bin\chuck.exe in c:\windows\system32\

---

To run chuck on osx, use the Terminal.
To run chuck on win32, use start->run: cmd. (or use cygwin)

Graphical editors and environments for chuck coming soon!

At this point, you should be able to invoke 'chuck' from any directory in 
Terminal (OSX) or 'cmd' (Windows) or cygwin (Windows):

    > chuck
    [chuck]: no input files... (try --help)

This is the correct output since we didn't specify any files to run.

You are ready to ChucK. If this is your first time programming in 
ChucK, you may want to look at the documentation, or take the ChucK 
Tutorial (in doc/ and online http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/). ThanK 
you very much. Go forth and ChucK - email us for support or to make a 
suggestion or to call us idiots.
